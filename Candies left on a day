Problem
Today, N candies were placed on the table. At any point, for the purpose of clarity, let X represent the number of candies left on the table. Every day, at 9 PM, if the number of candies remaining is divisible by 2, the child will take exactly X/2 candies. Otherwise, he will take (X+1)/2 candies.

In addition, every day at 10 PM, another child will come and take X//4, where the "//" here represents integer division. Please, find the number of candies left at 11 PM after T days have passed.

Input:
The first line contains one integer, Q, the number of test cases.
The next Q lines contain two integers, N and T.

Output:
Output Q lines, the answer for each test case.

Constraints:
1<=Q<=10
1<=N<=1016
1<=T<=50

Sample Input
1
2 1
Sample Output
1

CODE:

import java.util.*;
class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
       Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
       long n=sc.nextLong();
       for(long x=0;x<n;x++)
       {
        long N=sc.nextLong();
        long T=sc.nextLong();
        for(long i=0;i<T;i++)
        {
            if(N%2==0)
            {
                N-=N/2;
            }
            else if(N%2!=0)
            {
                N-=(N+1)/2;
            }
            N=N-(N/4);
        }
        System.out.println(N);
       }

    }
}
